# Changelog

## v1.0.10 - 2026-05-04

- Persisted full outfit draft state per user so name, notes, tags, and selected item IDs survive navigation between Closet and My Outfits.
- Synced My Outfits create-form fields directly with stored draft data to prevent losing in-progress outfit details while adding items.
- Kept draft item IDs filtered to available closet items when loading persisted drafts, preventing stale references after item deletes.

## v1.0.9 - 2026-05-04

- Refreshed the root `README.md`, `wiki.md`, and `PROJECT_INDEX.md` so the repository-level documentation matches the Milestone 1 app state.
- Rewrote `back-end/README.md` to document current auth flows, outfits endpoints, image-clean routes, and seeded demo data.
- Rewrote `front-end/README.md` to document the current signed-in closet flow, admin-only routes, outfits page, and frontend 404 behavior.

## v1.0.8 - 2026-05-04

- Added visible auth feedback for failed Google sign-in attempts and successful logout on the frontend landing flow.
- Added a dedicated frontend 404 state for unknown SPA routes instead of falling back to the closet page.
- Fixed outfit item tag labels to read from the current array-based tag model and removed duplicate env-loader logic from `start.sh`.

## v1.0.7 - 2026-05-04

- Updated Google sign-in to reuse an existing seeded user when the Google account email already exists in the database.
- Preserved seeded admin access by attaching the real Google UID to the existing user record instead of creating a duplicate account.
- Added regression test coverage for same-email and case-insensitive Google sign-in reuse.

## v1.0.6 - 2026-05-04

- Simplified demo seed data so the database now creates the real Northwestern admin account instead of additional Google users you cannot sign into locally.
- Seeded `annabelgoldman2025@u.northwestern.edu` with admin access and a 20-item demo closet.
- Removed extra seeded demo users so the development data better matches the team’s actual login flow.

## v1.0.5 - 2026-05-04

- Fixed the manual add-item back button so it consistently returns users to the closet page.
- Restricted users-directory navigation to admin users by adding an admin-only `Users` header button and removing non-admin UI paths into `/users`.
- Preserved the existing route-level authorization while making the UI navigation match the intended access rules more closely.

## v1.0.4 - 2026-05-04

- Merged the tag-based closet search and relaxed item schema work with the new outfits and lookbook experience from `main`.
- Preserved the polished closet filter bar updates alongside the My Outfits page, outfit draft persistence, and outfits CRUD support.
- Synced the branch to the current Milestone 1 codebase and tagged the combined release head.

## v1.0.3 - 2026-05-04

- Reworked clothing item metadata into a relaxed tag-based schema for create, edit, seed, and API payload flows.
- Added closet search, tag filtering, and sort controls aligned with the new tag-driven item model.
- Polished the closet filter bar layout so the search field and dropdown controls feel cleaner and more consistent.

## v1.0.2 - 2026-05-03

- Fixed deployed routing so browser visits to `/users` and `/users/:id` render the frontend app instead of raw JSON responses.
- Preserved JSON authorization behavior for API requests while restoring correct SPA fallback behavior for HTML requests.
- Added full outfits support across back-end and front-end, including outfit CRUD endpoints, user-scoped authorization, and outfit-to-item associations.
- Introduced new data models and schema updates for outfits and outfit items, including ownership validation and uniqueness constraints.
- Added the My Outfits experience with create/edit/delete flows and outfit item grouping from closet pieces.
- Added persistent outfit draft behavior so selected item IDs are saved per user and restored from local storage.
- Added and refined flash/toast notifications for outfit load/save/update/delete outcomes and draft confirmations.
- Added automated test coverage for outfit flows and validations, including integration tests and model tests for Outfit and OutfitItem.
